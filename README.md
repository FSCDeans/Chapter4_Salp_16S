# Chapter4_Salp_16S

This repository contains R scripts for analyzing 16S amplicon sequencing data from water masses to the east of New Zealand where salp blooms were and were not present. This code was used for analyses in chapter 4 of my PhD thesis titled "The influence of climate change on marine bacterioplankton communities and greenhouse gases in New Zealand waters"
